Taking a midweek day off always makes me feel a bit delinquent. Taking my leisure and doing fun stuff - in my case, usually going to galleries - while most of the people around me are at work. As it happens, the world of work is the guiding subject of [this impressive exhibition of paintings](https://www.jackbellgallery.com/exhibitions/139-felipe-rezende-long-is-the-road/overview/), though the environment and atmosphere the paintings portray is a world away from the Mayfair gallery that hosts them.

Felipe Rezende is an artist of unusual sensitivity, who lives in Salvador, Brazil. He paints workers with hard, physical jobs: takeaway drivers with massive backpacks, muscle-bound baseball-capped mechanics, middle-aged nurses in scrubs. He paints on the most workaday fabric imaginable, redolent of manual labour: truck tarpaulins, distressed to provide a textured surface for the oil paint.

None of these rough-and-ready canvases are large, and their frameless borders are frayed and jagged; as if they’re reused offcuts. A bit of tropical arte povera. The compositions are deliberately incomplete and spare: in the example above, our mechanic’s head and legs are simply left out; we only know what the subject does for a living by the artist’s addition of a sign, a tyre and a car hood elsewhere in the painting.

The greyish, gloomy background gives us the impression of obscuring clouds, from which our figures emerge. I say Rezende is sensitive because he treats his these figures with scrupulous respect, carefully picking out sinews on their well-worked arms, giving them a shared expression of resolute dignity, though their faces are always downcast, facing their work. They’re almost palpably human.

The title of the painting above translates as *Yellow Ox*. Maybe it’s the name of the restaurant the protagonist works. Wearing a bikini, she scrapes food on a hotplate, her great hand foreshortened as it points out at us. Her hair, like the bisected beast elsewhere on the painting, is bright yellow. The canvas bulges with stitching and pockets. She looks almost meditative, despite how uncomfortable she must be, working over a hot stove all day. I looked at her a long time.

“I construct arrangements that inhabit the interstices between the surreal and testimony, fiction and reality,” says Rezende in his note accompanying the show. He undersells himself, in my opinion. His figures seemed real to me - so real, they’ll be difficult to forget.
