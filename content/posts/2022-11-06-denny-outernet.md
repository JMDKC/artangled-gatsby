The bombastically-named Now Building, opened a couple of weeks ago opposite Tottenham Court Road tube station, has a blingy black and gold exterior and massive LED screens across every last bit of its interior walls and ceiling. It’s part of a newly-opened complex called the Outernet, which also includes a new theatre and the restoration of a very useful pathway to Soho Square.

While the Now Building’s screens usually show advertising, likely in a bid to recoup the no doubt astronomical costs of the complex, its owners have turned over some Sunday afternoon screen time to artists. First up to show is Simon Denny, with a voguish but tongue-in-cheek [graphical tribute to the early noughties](https://www.outernetglobal.com/news/outernet-arts-to-launch-with-simon-denny).

What did the Sunday afternoon viewers see? Drifting across the gorgeously high-definition screens, are a series of logos for unpromising-sounding organisations: capacityweb.com, cashwars.com, netmorf.com. Spot the similarity? All these are Dotcome companies, inflated and burst in the “Web 2.0” bubble at the turn of the millennium.

The logos themselves weren’t used at the time; they’ve been created by much newer Web3 technology: text-to-image AI. To make it especially up-to-date, each logo’s an NFT, yours to buy. (Which raises the possibility that we’ll have art shows paying tongue-in-cheek tribute to the early 2020s NFT bubble in 20 years time.)

For Denny, these dead companies are “ghosts”, and he adds to the spooky atmosphere by adorning the screens with Geocities-style graphical candles and a black background. He’s also termed the show as a whole an “[on-chain spiritualism session](https://www.dotcomseance.com/)”.

I found the mordant captions drifting across the screens, describing the companies’ absurd or dated business models, especially funny. Consider alladvantage.com (1999-2001), a browser that paid you to view ads. Or iharvest.com (1997-2001), which allowed you to archive static copies of web pages. The screens were huge and bright enough to make everything look cool, too.

Maybe laughing at capitalist follies of a previous decade is a sly comment on the ephemerality of our own late capitalist moment, exemplified by this very shiny big-screen bauble slap bang in the middle of the West End. The Now Building, with its AI NFT logos, is now, now; it’ll be Then, soon. Maybe we’ll look back and laugh.
