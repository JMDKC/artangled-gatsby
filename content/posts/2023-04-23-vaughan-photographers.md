[This exhibition](https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/hard-man-good-find) is carefully scoped: to a place (London), a group (gay men) and a period (between the 1930s and the 1990s). During this time, queer photographers took and shared images of hard-bodied men. For most of this time, this sharing was clandestine, gay sex being a criminal offence in the city until 1967. 

The photographers on show run the gamut from the famous - including [Cecil Beaton](/tags/cecil-beaton) and [Patrick Procktor](/tags/patrick-procktor) - to the near-anonymous and invisible, included to make a sociological point. The saddest item I saw is an all-text ad for “Exclusive photo sets” of “‘above-average’ in every way” models, each reduced to a single one-line description for desperate and horny buyers. (“DAVE - Londoner.C. Art student with lots of charm!” for example. That's all they got.) Once chosen, the photo sets were presumably sent to the buyers in discreet envelopes.

This all seems like another world to the Londoners touring the exhibition on a Thursday evening, most of whom, judging by appearances, would have been sending off for a few shots of Dave if they’d had the misfortune to be born a few decades earlier. These days, they have the option of popping to the gay sauna over the road from the gallery after a spin round the exhibition. There’s nothing clandestine about Sweatbox, its exterior walls prominently featuring its own style of physique photography to lure in passers-by.

The city’s gay areas have also shifted - Earl’s Court, Notting Hill and Pimlico were all heavily frequented by the physique photographers and their ilk during the middle of the century, and are all locations featured in the exhibition. But I can’t name so much as a gay pub in any of them these days. 

A few meeting points have stayed the same, though. One of these is Highgate Men’s Pond, where the gays of yesterday and today go in summer to watch and be watched. The (almost unchanged) changing room next to the pond is the location for a set of photos taken by [Keith Vaughan](/tags/keith-vaughan) which are almost a century old, but could be from last summer by the looks of them.

Vaughn, who went on to be a celebrated Neo-Romantic painter, took photos of hard-bodied young men in that familiar concrete-floored, iron-walled, open-ceilinged room in 1933, when he was 21. He didn’t put them on public display, but compiled them in a scrapbook, I guess for his private pleasure.

The sunbathers, in their pants and posing pouches, are sometimes cut out and pasted on colour block backgrounds. The days' temperatures, in Fahrenheit, are etched alongside these blocks, in an artistic collage evocative of heat and promise. The scrapbook made me think of the summer to come, 90 summers later, and how we’ll see the same scenes in the same places, again, an unbroken line of continuity with the past. Though this time around, any such images will likely be selfies, distributed to the photographer’s close friends list on Instagram, rather than consigned to a private scrapbook.

What a beautiful, stylish labour of love Vaughan’s scrapbook is, though. It’s not a coincidence that the scope of this show ends in the mid-1990s, after when online porn became available to the city’s queers and their global brethren. After which, the clandestine analog thrills provided by old-fashioned physique photography became… just clandestine thrills, enabled by way more explicit material. 

Maybe a bit less thrilling for being less hard-won. But that's the price you pay for progress.
