“Ye cannot serve God and mammon,” claims the gospel of Matthew. But [this exhibition at the Hill Art Foundation](https://hillartfoundation.org/art/exhibitions/view/lux-and-lumen/), a small gallery owned by hedge fund billionaire J. Tomlinson Hill, gives it a good go. It’s currently hosting a beautiful exhibition that brings together a Renaissance stained glass window and various stained glass installations from contemporary artist Spencer Finch.

*The Creation and the Expulsion from Paradise* was completed by Valentin Bousch in 1533, and has most recently been a prize possession of rich American collectors: it used to be installed above William Randolph Hearst’s fireplace, according to the show notes.

In its new temporary home, Bousch’s illuminated Adam and Eve, his God the Father and Holy dove, all gaze out on Finch’s main installation, entitled *Painting Air*: perfect squares of clear glass, suspended from the ceiling by a cats cradle of wires and overlooked by a chatty guard who wished to make *very* sure visitors weren’t wearing backpacks before getting into range. The show must have been a nightmare to install and maintain, in other words. 

It’s worth it. Reflections and colours drift across the clear glass panes: from the bold colour fields on the gallery walls, from the spectacular floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking 10th Avenue, and from the 500-year-old billionaire-coveted stained glass in the corner. It’s one of the most breathtaking things I’ve seen.

“Sometimes the light is magical in New York,” Finch said in an interview. “It will just feel like - maybe this is a sort of sacred light… And then it passes. You then get back on the subway and you have some horrible experience. But for a moment, it feels like a magical, wonderful place. It’s almost the Holy Spirit entering you or something.”

A feeling that’s reflected in the *Lux* means natural light, *Lumen* is sacred light. Through art, the former may be transmuted into the latter, like water into wine. Equally, money can buy - or fund - great art, which in turn allows others to gain, briefly, transcendence. A process that might not be sacred in Biblical terms, but yields undeniable results, whatever your beliefs.
