[This exhibition](https://www.maureenpaley.com/exhibitions/andrew-grassie-looking-for-something-that-doesnt-exist) is seasonally appropriate. I viewed Andrew Grassie’s monochrome paintings on a dark January day, on which the sun seemed barely to lift from the horizon. The gallery, in an old school building, was viciously lit as if to compensate for the gloomy outside, making these small, grey, wintry paintings even harder to make out.

Which is probably quite appropriate, given the subject matter. Over the past couple of years, London-based Grassie has spent a considerable amount of time on the shores of Loch Ness, a place of mystery, home of the mythical Loch Ness Monster.

Each of the paintings on show are sourced by photos taken by the artist on one of his walks. You wouldn’t know where he was without the titles of the paintings, though: forget Nessie, Grassie doesn’t even paint the loch in the paintings on show. The water’s somewhere over there, between the dark silhouetted pines in *Through the Trees*, pictured above.

All the paintings are egg tempera on paper. This lends Grassie’s scenes a clarity and sharpness - he can work minute details into his tree trunks with the close care of the Northern Renaissance masters that used the same kind of paint. Unless you look very closely, you’d say they were silver print photos.

Grassie lavishes care and attention on contrasting textures. Like the slightly mouldy wooden window frames and corrugated iron walls frayed with rust in *Flags*. Again, the scene is presumably on the shores of the lake, but the water isn’t shown.

The show notes tell us that the artist got inspiration from walking around the area at night, and his decision to work in shades of grey makes it uncannily ambiguous whether the scenes are happening during the day or night - just like that other legendary artist/night walker [Léon Spilliaert](/tags/leon-spilliaert).

So, the viewer wonders, what time is it exactly, in the interior scene depicted in *Lampshade*? Is the meticulously set table glimpsed in *Window Seat* set for breakfast or dinner?

Aside from his walks, Grassie himself says he was originally inspired to use Loch Ness from an old photo of a Nessie-hunter which he kept on his studio wall. In the photo, the man is training his binoculars on the lake in the hope the monster would, at last, emerge. “He was patiently investing his time and attention scanning the opaque grey waters in the hope that there might be something there and that he might be witness to it,” Grassie adds. 

“Perhaps this was not so different from a painter like me, reproducing photographs, hoping that in that very act of duplication something surplus may appear.”

These lake waters have been refracted through multiple layers of myth and meaning - the legend of the Loch Ness monster, inspiring a man with binoculars, inspiring a London artist to himself take photos, paint small grey paintings from them, which are then scrutinised and interpreted by me in an overlit old classroom in East London on a dark afternoon in January.

That’s no bad thing though. There’s nothing special about the actual lake. To make that point, Grassie set a large plastic screw-top tub, half full of Loch Ness water, directly in the middle of the gallery. The work’s called *0.000000000002013% of Loch Ness*. 

The humdrum nothingness of the greeny-grey water made me turn back to the painting of the bare pines, to look closer, to try to make out the lake, somewhere in the background. How uninteresting the real thing, in a plastic jerry can behind me, seemed by comparison!
