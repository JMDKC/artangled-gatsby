Harland Miller is a novelist as well as a painter, and his best-known works bring the two media together. I’ve seen (and loved) his large painted versions of Penguin book covers, with their mordant titles, and with the artist’s name itself resplendent in the author’s slot.

He’s now [taken over the large, coldly-lit White Cube space in Bermondsey](https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/Harland_Miller_White_Cube_Bermondsey_2022), with 45 paintings and works on paper, all produced this year. So productive! Many are in midcentury book-cover format (title, author/artist name, abstract illustration), but as a whole, they’re more abstracted and painterly than the older Penguin pastiches.

There are some classic book titles, in Miller’s unmistakeable tone - funny phrases, memorable for their grammatical imperfections and weird rhythms. Examples here: ‘Imminent End Rescheduled Eternally’, or ‘Up as a Superposition’. But often, these new large paintings have single-word titles: ’Numb’, ‘Nude’, ‘If’. This last one is the largest of all, taking pride of place in the main gallery - no painted author name to supplement the two-letter title, it doesn’t resemble a book cover at all.

Miller’s breaking out of pastiche and wordplay, and experimenting with paint. The carefully-worked letters of *If* in particular, with their layers of splotches, marshalled across the huge canvas, almost seems like a rebuke of the earlier work. The letters are truncated - it looks more like IT - and fully integrated into the colour blocks and drips that surround them. He seems to be aiming for earlier, gestural greats, like Asger Jorn (a named influence) or maybe Jasper Johns, whose stencilled letters were always firmly subordinated to the paint they were rendered in.

The artist almost sounds sceptical of his own considerable power with words, in the show notes at least. “People read before they can stop themselves, it’s automatic,” he says. “Words offer a way into what you’re looking at, but no matter how integrated the text is, no matter how much you might think it’s synthesised into the painting, there is this imbalance in terms of how much the words are doing as words.”

He should be careful about that. I noticed that my fellow gallery goers hustled around the recognisable book covers, delighting in his phrasing, his wit. Commercial imperatives ought to play their part too: Miller reminds me of his compatriot David Shrigley, [featured on here last year](/shrigley-stephen-friedman), not just for his offbeat humour, or his will-to-power productivity, but also for his *sellability*.

Is that why all the smaller works on paper are signed and numbered, even doodles of letters on graph paper? Are the spots and splotches of paint that accompany his outline drawings part of his painterly experiments, or just value-building?

Miller will seal the deal with many visitors, who’ll snap up the (very fine) new £80 Phaidon-published monograph, on sale at the gallery’s shop by the exit. That’s aimed at people like me who can’t afford a drawing, let alone a painting.

I’m sure people who buy it will mostly flip to those book covers, with their funny titles. Enjoyable works from a writer who paints.
