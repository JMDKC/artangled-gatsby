My last trip to the Frieze tent, [in 2019](/tejada-frieze), ended up as a bit of a disaster, not that I admitted it on here at the time. After 3 hours of walking, looking intently, elbowing aside crowds and becoming increasingly unbalanced by loading more and more free merchandise into my straining tote, I ended up having a quiet dry heave in Benugo, vowing *never again*. If you’re insufficiently important to buy any of the work on show in there, then you’re effectively paying quite a lot to be overstimulated to the point of exhaustion - not really the best frame of mind to look at art.

[This one](https://www.frieze.com/article/frieze-sculpture-returns-regents-park-2021) was way better - and I promise that’s the way I actually felt about it, this time. I didn’t brave the tent, but exercised the wallet-friendly alternative of viewing the sculpture exhibits outside. Really convenient as it happens: it’s in the corner of Regent’s Park next to my office. So, rather than being hyper focused, wired on FOMO and surrounded by sweaty indoors hordes, my 2021 Frieze experience was a slow half-hour ramble on a sunny lunch hour, accompanied by a few mums with children, joyfully ignoring the (silly) “please don’t touch or climb” signs on many of the tempting sculptures on show.

I enjoyed Gisela Colón’s giant shiny space dick (Sorry, *Quantum Shift, (Parabolic Monolith Sirius Titanium)*), a sly feminising of pompous masculine tropes which [reminded me of Sylvie Fleury](/oehlen-hetzler). And it was great, [having seen the offcuts at Holtermann Fine Art](/otero-pailos-holtermann) a couple of weeks back, to see Jorge Otero-Pailos’ giant *Biosignature Preservation*, made from destroyed sections of a Bush-era American Embassy security fence.

Sculpture parks should always be aimed at pleasing people, rather than bat-squeaking esoterica, and Frieze got the memo this year. Hence two large installations of coloured glass that looked just lovely in the sunshine:  José Pedro Croft’s and *Environnement de Transchromie Circulaire*, a reproduction of a 1965 work from Carlos Cruz-Diez, a kind of groovy Stonehenge that’s irresistible to photograph for the gram… I took several, including the one above.

A nice way to spend a lunch hour, then, and no breakdowns in Benugo this time. Who needs another tote, either?
