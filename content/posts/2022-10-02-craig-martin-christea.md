Pieter Saenredam’s paintings of bracingly minimal church interiors helped to define the Dutch Golden Age, artistically at least. Saenredam was a master of shades of white, his pared down palette expertly tracing his whitewashed walls, the play of light on them, or the marks of Catholic ornamentation that had been wrenched or scrubbed away.

Michael Craig-Martin’s also known for his use of colour, though he prefers a hard, flat and bold palette. In t[his exhibition of new works](https://cristearoberts.com/exhibitions/241-michael-craig-martin-past-present/), Craig-Martin committed the (self-described) “sacrilege” of recreating Saenredam’s *Interior of the Sint-Odulphskerk in Assendelft* as a line drawing, then printing it in several different colourways, including this ultimate inversion - one in black.

It’s a painting I’ve been interested in for years - [I wrote about it here during lockdown](https://artangled.com/sanraedam-rijksmuseum), when the galleries were closed. In the black-and-blue print, form of the church is identical. But, along with the colour, Craig-Martin makes further changes to pare things down: removing all of Saenredam’s tiny figures from the church interior, and wiping out the scuffs and abrasions from his tiled floor, making it appear like a pure perspective grid.

Saenredam’s church is just one of the old master works reimagined by Craig-Martin in this show. Each source painting is pared back. For example, the faces of the king and queen in the mirror in Velazquez’s *Las Meninas* are rendered absolutely clear in Craig-Martin’s print. Da Vinci’s *Mona Lisa* has the folds of her double chin brutally rendered. That’s because Craig-Martin’s technique depends on clear delineations, sharp lines separating blocks of colour.

“I use colour to support but also challenge the line drawing,” Craig-Martin says. “I employ a small palette of intense pure colours to give the work emotional life, visual differentiation, structure and rhythm.” 

Some of these choices gave me a real jolt - especially the black church, but also the Smurf-like tone of Piero’s flagellated Christ (above), or the hot pink rendering of Caravaggio’s *Bacchus*, making the curly-headed boy look as sweet and synthetic as a Chewit.

Craig-Martin claims this flattening is “unhierarchical”, both in the look of the prints. You could huff at the chutzpah of a modern draughtsman meeting the old masters of the past as an equal rather than a mere respectful observer. Or you could reflect that, in this meeting, today’s artist has picked out details that are easily missed from these great works of the past, clarified and complicated them, made something new. In case it’s not obvious, I agree with the latter view.
