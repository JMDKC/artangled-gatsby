I’ve always liked a good [thematic group shows](https://artangled.com/empreinte-malingue), and [this one at Parafin](http://www.parafin.co.uk/exhibitions--2021--the-forest.html) didn’t disappoint. Dark forests are part of our shared cultural consciousness, even for those of us who live in the middle of large cities. The lonely forest represents a quiet place to retreat to and hide. But monsters may also lurk there.

The exhibition begins with [an engraving](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_Dante_Alighieri_-_Inferno_-_Plate_1_.jpg) from the mystical French artist Gustave Doré to set the scene. It’s an illustration of the opening canto of Dante’s *Divine Comedy*, one of literature’s [most famous forests](https://poets.org/poem/inferno-canto-i):

> Midway upon the journey of our life  
> I found myself within a forest dark,  
> For the straightforward pathway had been lost.  

Doré’s forest isn’t a place of sanctuary, really, his protagonist casting a confused look over his shoulder as he treads over gnarly tree roots. The sky is completely blotted out by overhanging branches. It’s dark in there, confusing. As well as beautiful.

This theme of beauty and threat was reflected in my two favourite works from the exhibition. The Lithuanian photographer Indrė Šerpytytė photographed forests as part of her *1944-1991* series. Close cropped, the layers of trees merge into each other, the variegated effects of light and shade confusing our depth perception. They’re palpably sinister; we can hardly see where the ground is, and our eyes strain for what’s hidden under the canopy. The example above is *Forest Brothers IV* from 2009.

In fact, Šerpytytė photographed hiding places for resistance fighters, battling the Stalinist Soviet regime in the aftermath of the Second World War. The dense foliage served as a hiding place for these men, who had left their homes for fear of being put to death. And, inevitably, the forest served as a grave for many of them. Their refuge among the trees was involuntary.

So the work plays into the double-edged forest feeling described above: the forest as a place for solace and retreat, but *at the same time* as a threatening, lonely place.

A similar sense of foreboding pervades a series of pictures from UK-based German photographer Melanie Manchot. In two works at Parafin, she depicts traces of snow left behind in dense pine forests, at night. *Remains (End of the World)*, from 2018 and pictured above, lives up to its apocalyptic title. The snow on the ground is almost the only source of light, weakly reflecting a single patch of sky visible at the top of the frame.

Everywhere else is pervading blackness, with the pine tree canopy extremely dense. Only a few tree trunks are picked out in the gloom. The forest seems endless. It’s beautiful - and thank you Parafin for leaving this C-print uncovered by any reflective surface to take away from the deep blacks of this photograph.

The silent sylvan scenes in all three works - Doré, Šerpytytė, Manchot - have great natural beauty, but are freighted with dread. That the mood persists across all three is a tribute to the exhibition’s great curation, as well as the power of this cultural archetype. I loved to get lost in these forests, safely surrounded by the bustling city on a rainy summer afternoon.
