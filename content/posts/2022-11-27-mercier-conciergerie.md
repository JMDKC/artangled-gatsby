On a rainy November’s morning in the dead centre of Paris, I [experienced a show](https://www.paris-conciergerie.fr/en/News/The-Sleeping-Chapter-of-Theo-Mercier) that can only be described as dreamy. 

Théo Mercier is an artist I admire a lot - and have [featured on here before](/mercier-bugada). He works in a monumental register, but with a whimsical sense of humour; he reflects on the ephemerality of things, the fragility of the present as we lose it, inevitably, to the future.

In that previous exhibition I featured - that I saw in this city in 2017 - Mércier cast Classical-looking amphoras, busts and pillars in thin plaster, and set them at dangerously teetering angles. This time, he uses an even more easily-messed-up material: sand. Sand that’s the same colour of the spectacular medieval hall of the Conciergerie, in which this installation is set.

Working with a team of sand sculptors, Mércier created mattresses, pillows and beds - the tools we use to get us to sleep. There’s the odd broken pillar too, to keep things consistent: this time, they’re the exact size of the chunky pillars that hold up this 600-year-old roof. The sand was also selected to match the shade of the stone that surrounds it as well as possible. 

Watching over these ornaments are dogs, sculpted in a slightly lighter sand, lying down at rest, but with their eyes open and watchful. Wafting around the hall is a spooky soundtrack of breaths and pulsations. Given that it was a weekday morning, and that most of my fellow tourists skip the Conciergerie in favour of the neighbouring Sainte Chappelle, the room was empty enough to maintain the illusion - that I had entered dreamland, that I was surrounded by stillness.

Perhaps it’s a good thing more people haven’t come. Bravely, these extremely fragile sculptures are totally unprotected from the circulating audience: no ropes, no buzzers, very few security staff. Inevitably, that’s meant that some of the sculptures - a corner of a mattress here, the tail of a dog there - are already damaged, the shaped sand exploded into dust.

When talking about his aims for the show, part of a broader series called “Outremonde” (meaning “underworld”, or literally “out world”), the artist says: “Being in the heart of Paris, a city that brings together all possible types of sleep, also makes the place very mysterious and I wanted to talk about what these types of sleep say about our lives. 

“Because talking about sleep is also talking about the city, a place of all possible dreams and nightmares.” Exactly. Leaving the spectacular hall felt to me like waking up, refreshed but also a bit perturbed by what I’d seen, back in dreamland.
