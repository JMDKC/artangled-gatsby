Chilean artist Alejandro Cardenas based  the [works in this exhibition](https://www.alminerech.com/exhibitions/8543-alejandro-cardenas) around a story in Homer’s Odyssey. He owes some artistic debts to Rousseau, in his frequent use of lush, verdant backdrops, and to de Chirico in the quietude of his pictorial atmospheres, as well as his perspectival clarity.

Odysseus took seven years out from his… well, odyssey, by having fun with the nymph Calypso on her private island. An extremely kind host, she gives him food (and other sensual pleasures), and even gives him the tools to build his boat to escape with when he misses his wife too much to stay.

I mention these particulars of the story because there’s something deeply luxurious about Cardenas’ works. Despite his faceless, deliberately robotic figures, with their birdlike heads and spindly limbs, there’s also more than a suggestion of sensual pleasures. 

The main room features statues of the pair: the man standing in a power pose, the nymph prone, legs slightly apart. The statues are bronze, on plinths; the poses are sinuous, set off by strips of shinier metal.

They’re surrounded by canvases that show them on the island, in bright acrylic paint. The paintings mainly show these mysterious, elegant, faceless figures partying on Calypso’s jungly tropical island. Though in others, the figures are closed off in cuboid cell-like rooms, with the titles of the paintings suggesting confinement.

In other words, Cardenas strikes a tasteful balance between cold bronze and hot paint. Between enjoying the company of a hospitable nymph and yearning for the more familiar pleasures of home.
