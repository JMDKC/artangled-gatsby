The multimedia artist Cudelice Brazelton IV was born in Dallas and studied in Germany, where he now lives. The notes for [this show, Brazelton’s first in London](https://www.cellprojects.org/artists/exhibitions), state he spent some time in between “working in Ohio’s industrial foundries”. That sounds like, but doesn’t quite explicitly state, that he had a job in a factory. Or maybe it was a fancy art residency.

Either way, it’s the sounds and sights of the factory that’s inspired and guided the exhibition. It’s not much to look at at first glance: a few, small wall-mounted metal boxes are gridded with tensioned rubber bands. One of these attached to a Singer sewing machine pedal on the floor, and lights up from within when the pedal is pressed.

Another is an implacable little square of grey foam, with two white beads pressed into the surface, eye distance apart. Another bit of sheet metal has a single inkjet printed phrase in its centre: AUTO PICTURE.

These aesthetically underwhelming but vaguely threatening objects, sparsely displayed, are like industrial products, factory-produced. Auto pictures, automatic art. The workers remain invisible. You can’t help but think Brazelton didn’t have a great time at his “industrial foundry”, regardless of whether he was there as a labourer or on a bursary.

The show’s themes come together with *Abrade* (2022). This time, the sheet metal is in an Art Deco-style shape, bringing the viewer back to the 1930s, a time in which artists like Charles Sheeler and Stuart Davis portrayed factories and industry as pristine engines of progress.

Brazelton undercuts this 20th century sentiment by slotting into the back of his work a grainy inkjet print of a shabby factory floor. Echoing through the gallery, and emanating from this work, is an ambient soundtrack which sounds like a recording live from the seventh circle of hell, but which the show notes say is of a giant factory magnet moving metal train couplers along the line. 

The sounds were recorded by a local musician, at the very same factory that Brazelton worked. “Abrade” means “to scrape or wear away”. Everything degrades and falls apart eventually, he’s telling us: even the toughest industrial materials.
