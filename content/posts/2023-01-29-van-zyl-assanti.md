I love [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msuXu-uAJ5U) of Jenkin van Zyl’s “extreme beauty regime”. The young artist and filmmaker seems delighted by the attention, cheerfully explaining the ins and outs of applying silicon horns, which he does every day, in his impeccably plummy Home Counties accent. The video’s intercut with van Zyl striding around east London and eating a takeaway in full kabuki makeup, facial prosthetics and a blow-up latex body suit, like a lither [Leigh Bowery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om0MrCOXPcE) for millennials.

Van Zyl’s films, the latest of which is [on show now at Eden Assanti](https://edelassanti.com/exhibitions/113-jenkin-van-zyl-surrender/) are long, lushly-shot and narrative-driven. When I saw his film *Machines of Love* at the [Royal Academy Schools Show last year](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/ra-schools-show-2021) - van Zyl did a postgraduate degree there - I wondered where he could possibly have found the budget for the costumes, the soundtrack, the location work. The artist suggested he used old film sets, dodging security guards and guard dogs, to keep things on a “[micro budget](https://edelassanti.com/news/472/)” and shot previous films on GoPros. The work as well as the man uses an extreme beauty regime to flatter and decieve, in other words.

The latest film, *Surrender*, used actual booked-out locations for the first time. But it was still shot on a shoestring. “I do too much stuff,” the artist said [in a recent interview](https://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/jenkin-van-zyl-interview-the-world-has-ended-many-times-over). “I really want to have the money to work with other people but, because of necessity, I do all the costumes, the camera, the editing work, the sound. But that’s all under direction, in a way.” This seems breathtakingly impressive, but I guess is a piece of cake with someone committed enough to apply silicon horns to their head every single day.

Anyway, *Surrender* reflects many of van Zyl’s fascinations that can be seen in the previous films, too: techno music, fetish outfits, campy gore, creepy masks. That list might make it sound off-putting and disturbing - but that’s not it at all. It’s as fun to watch van Zyl’s fantastic characters in rat tails, rat masks and high heels caper around his sets - a bedroom, a ballroom, an industrial facility - as it is to watch the artist put on his makeup and prosthetics. There’s a shared and infectious sense of fun and joy in being a bit naughty and deviant.

Characters in *Surrender* (the lead is actually played by Alex Margo Arden, who I’ve [featured on here before](/arden-frederick)) are soaked in stage blood and viscera. The plot’s based on some pretty hideous inspirations - in this case, the legend of the “rat king” (google it if you have a strong stomach) and the Depression-era dance marathons where poverty-stricken couples kept moving for days on end for a tiny cash prize. But a sign of its ultimate appeal is that there were so many people in the gallery, and that so many, including me, stayed to watch to the end of the 40-minute film.

Maybe I did because I was sat so comfortably: the red-lit screening room has hotel-style beds facing the big screen, mirroring one of *Surrender*’s sets. I perched on one side of the bed closest to the door, feet kept on the ground, sunk into the soft mattress. A way more comfortable gallery viewing experience than usual. That said though, there was a pipe that dug into my back - a representation of the same suction pipes that deliver messages to the rat characters in the film, telling them about that day’s campily hideous trial. 

I only figured out what it was after a few minutes - being so riveted by what was on the screen that I didn’t have the bandwidth to figure out *exactly* what was digging into my back. Luckily, this slight discomfort among all the stimulation serves as a nice metaphor for the experience of van Zyl’s art as a whole.
