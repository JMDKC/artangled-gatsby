Like Antoni Tàpies, [featured on here last week](/tapies-nahmad), Romauld Hazoumè uses found objects in his work. But, [as this show highlights](https://octobergallery.co.uk/exhibitions/Hazoume-carnaval), the two artists could hardly be more different. Hazoumè is droll, down to earth and humanist where Tàpies is grand and ethereal. 

The artist, who lives and works in Benin, uses discarded oilcans, bottles, feathers and other throwaway objects to produce what he calls *masques bidons* (repurposed masks). The title of the exhibition’s a clue to the kind of atmosphere Hazoumè wants to create: just like at a carnival parade, the masks shouldn’t just look good, they can also be a kind of subversive social commentary or satire.

That helps explain why some of these plastic bottle-and-feather masks are named after African leaders. Others have a more down-to-earth inspiration. “My masks represent impromptu impressions of people I know of and have seen; some of them might even be people you may well recognise!” the artist adds.

Hazoumè can afford to take this easy-going attitude to inspiration because the inspiration is *local* to him. He sidesteps the reductive appropriation of African mask imagery from the Dadaists and other 20th century western artistic movements.

But while such weighty inferences are side-stepped, they can’t be escaped. After all, such masks are originally objects of religious reverence, and repurposing their imagery using plastic cans and spoons (as in *Napo*, above), might seem a bit off to a local audience. Hazoumè himself insists the masks “in no way resemble those originally powerful African masks used for ceremonial purposes”. Oh really?

And isn’t the use of oilcans itself symbolically loaded, given the ongoing exploitation of the region’s oil reserves both by global energy companies and corrupt local politicians? 

Or maybe that’s a misreading on my part as an outsider - that it’s actually carnival time, that these battered and now repurposed bottles carried something harmless, originally - and that I should just let the party continue. Either way, this is a fascinating collection, put together with a pleasingly light touch.
